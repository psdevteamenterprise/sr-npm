     * and `prev()` methods of the `WixDataResult` object are used to

     * Includes referenced items for the specified properties in a search's results.
     *
     * The `include()` method refines a search so that the items returned in the
     * search's results include the full referenced items for the specified properties.
     *
     * For example, suppose you have a **books** collection with an **author**
     * field that references an **authors** collection. Searching the **books**
     * collection with an `include("author")` returns the relevant book items
     * and each item will include the full referenced author item in the book's
     * `author` property.
     *
     * When searching a collection that contains a reference field without using the
     * `include()` method:
     * - Single reference field: returned items contain only the ID of the
     *   referenced item, and not the full referenced items.
     * - Multiple reference field: returned items do not contain the multiple
     *   reference field at all.
     *
     *  When including a property with multiple references, the following limitations
     *  apply:
     *  - Only one property with multiple references can be included.
     *  - The search will return an error if more than 50 items are returned, regardless
     *    of any search limit set using the `limit()` method.
     *  - Each returned item can include up to 50 referenced items. If there are more
     *    than 50 referenced items, only 50 are returned when the search is run
     *    and the `partialIncludes` property of the returned `WixDataResult` is `true`.
