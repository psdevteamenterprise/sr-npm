/**
 * Retrieves the items referenced in the specified field of a referring item. Reference fields refer to items that exist in different collections. Implement this function so callers can retrieve the full details of the referenced items.
 *
 * This service plugin supports item multi-references, which means that data collections can have many-to-many relationships with other collections. For example, consider a scenario where a **Movies** collection includes a multi-reference **Actors** field, which might refer to several **Actor** items in an **Actors** collection. Users can therefore query the **Movies** collection to retrieve the **Actor** items referenced in each **Movie** item.
 *
 * > **Notes:**
 * > - This function does not retrieve the full referenced items of referenced items. For example, the referenced **Actors** collection might itself contain a multi-reference field with references to **Award** items in an **Awards** collection. When calling this function to retrieve the referenced items of any **Movie** item, the response contains the referenced **Actor** items, but only the IDs of the **Award** items. To retrieve the full **Award** items, the user must either call this function for the **Actors** collection, or the [`queryDataItems()`](/external-database/query-data-items) function for the **Awards** collection.
 * > - This function might also be called when a user calls the [`isReferenced()`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/data/items/is-referenced-data-item) function of the Data API.
