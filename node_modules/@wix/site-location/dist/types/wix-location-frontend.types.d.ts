 * subitems on a page that is managed by a full-page application.
 *
 * For example, a store product page is a full-page application. When a product page's path
 * changes because it is switching between items, no actual navigation is taking place. You
 * can use the `onChange()` event handler to determine when a new product is displayed and
 * perform any necessary partial updates on the current page.
 *
 * The `onChange()` function can only be used when browser
 * [rendering](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-about-the-page-rendering-process) happens,
 * meaning you can only use it in frontend code after the page is ready.
 *
 * To determine if a page is managed by a full-page application, use the `wix-site-frontend`
 * [`currentPage`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/velo/api-reference/wix-site-frontend/current-page) property or [`getSiteStructure()`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/velo/api-reference/wix-site-frontend/get-site-structure)
 * function to retrieve a `StructurePage` object that
 * corresponds to the page. If the object contains an `applicationId` value, then the
 * page is managed by a full-page application.
 * @param handler - The name of the function or
 *  the function expression to run when the location changes.

/**
 * Directs the browser to navigate to the specified URL.
 *
 * The `to()` function navigates the browser to another web page.
 *
 *  The `to()` function can only be used when browser
 *  [rendering](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-about-the-page-rendering-process) happens,
 *  meaning you can only use it in frontend code after the page is ready.
 *
 *  The following link patterns are supported:
 *
 *  + `/localPageURL`: Another page on your site.
 *  + `/localPageURL#`: Another page on your site scrolled to the
 *     element with the specified ID. The element must be an element that supports
 *     the `scrollTo` function.
 *  + `/localPageURL?queryParam=value`: Another page on your site with query parameters.
 *  + `/`: Your site's home page.
 *  + `http(s)://`: An external web address.
 *  + `wix:document://`: A document stored in the Media Manager.
 *  + `mailto:@?subject=`: An email.
 *  + `tel:`: A phone number.
 *
 *
 *  To find the local URL of a page on your site in the Editor:
 *
 *  + Regular page: See the **SEO** tab of the **Page Settings** panel.
 *  + Dynamic page: See the **Page Info** tab of the **Page Settings** panel
 *    for the URL structure. The actual URL used for navigation needs to contain
 *    values where the placeholders are.
 *
 *    For example, if the URL structure of your dynamic page looks like:
 *
 *    ![Dynamic Page URL](https://wixmp-833713b177cebf373f611808.wixmp.com/images/velo-images/media_dynamic_url.png "Dynamic Page URL")
 *
 *    and you have an item with the title "Waffles", the local URL to that page
 *    is /Recipes/Waffles.
 *  + Router page: You cannot navigate directly to a specific router page. You
 *    can navigate to a URL with the router's prefix and the router code
 *    decides which page to route to.
 *
 *  By default, when navigating to a new URL for a Wix page, the page scrolls to the top. Set
 *  the `disableScrollToTop` navigation parameter property to `true` if you want the
 *  page to remain at the current Y-axis position as the previously-viewed page.
 *
 *  The `to()` function attempts to properly encode the URL parameter that
 *  is passed to it. For example, `.../some page` is encoded to
 *  `.../some%20page`. However, some URLs do not have one unambiguous encoding.
 *  In those cases it is up to you to encode the URL to reflect your intentions.
 *  Because of these situations, it is a best practice to always encode URLs
 *  before you pass them to the `to()` function.
 *
 *  Note that Wix URLs do not contain spaces. A page which has spaces in its
 *  name has its spaces replaced with dashes (`-`). Similarly, a dynamic page
 *  whose URL contains the value of a field in your collection with spaces
 *  has its spaces replaced with dashes (`-`).
 *
 *  > **Note:** The `to()` function does not work while previewing your site.
 * @param url - The URL of the page or website to navigate to.
 * @requiredField url
 * @param options - Options to use when navigating to the specified URL, such as scrolling options.
